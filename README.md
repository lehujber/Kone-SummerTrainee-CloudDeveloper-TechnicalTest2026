# Key data types
The application functions with the key data type of a seashell:
```json
    {
        "name": string,
        "species": string,
        "description": string,
        "personal_notes": string,
        "date_found": date <YYYY-MM-DD>
    }
```
Example:
```json
    {
        "name": "Golden Lion Pawasdfasdf",
        "species": "Lyropecten nodosus",
        "description": "A heavy, thick-shelled scallop with large nodes on the ribs. Bright orange to purplish color.",
        "personal_notes": "Anna spotted this one half-buried in the sand at Low Tide Beach. It's the highlight of our collection so far!",
        "date_found": "2026-02-21"
    }
```

This type from here on will be referred to as SEASHELL.
Another key type is a seashell with an id attached, which is the same as SEASHELL but with a database generated id attached:
```json
    {
        "id": int,
        "name": string,
        "species": string,
        "description": string,
        "personal_notes": string,
        "date_found": date <YYYY-MM-DD>
    }
```
Example:
```json
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Golden Lion Pawasdfasdf",
        "species": "Lyropecten nodosus",
        "description": "A heavy, thick-shelled scallop with large nodes on the ribs. Bright orange to purplish color.",
        "personal_notes": "Anna spotted this one half-buried in the sand at Low Tide Beach. It's the highlight of our collection so far!",
        "date_found": "2026-02-21"
    }
```
This type from here on will be referred to as SEASHELL_ID
